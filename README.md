# Sentiment Analysis for Customer Service Improvement

## Project Overview
This project implements an NLP system with sentiment analysis to improve customer service operations. It analyzes customer reviews to predict sentiment, simulate response times, and estimate customer satisfaction and retention rates.

## Dataset
The project uses the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which includes:
- Reviews from Oct 1999 - Oct 2012
- 568,454 reviews
- 256,059 users
- 74,258 products
- 260 users with > 50 reviews

## Features
- Sentiment analysis using both VADER and RoBERTa models
- Simulation of customer service metrics (response time, satisfaction, retention)
- Comparison of model performances
- Visualization of results

## Key Results
- 40% improvement in simulated response times
- Enhanced customer satisfaction metrics
- Increased customer retention rates

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy for data manipulation
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Hugging Face Transformers for RoBERTa model
- matplotlib, seaborn for data visualization

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages.
3. Download the dataset (not included in the repository due to size)
4. Run the main script: `python sentiment_analysis.py`

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on domain-specific data
- Implementing real-time analysis for live customer service interactions
- Expanding the analysis to multi-language support
